# Customer-Churn-Analysis-in-Power-BI

 In this case study, I've analyzed a fictional company's churn rate and visualized the insights through an interactive dashboard. Here are some key highlights:

✨Visualization of the churn rate distribution in terms of states has paved the way to further targeted investigation of the rise of the churn rate in specific locations
✨Churn rate distribution by age has led to the fact that elderly (60+) people are churning more than the younger customers
✨Variation of Churn rate by the contract type revealed that monthly subscribers are more likely to churn than yearly subscribers
✨New customers are more likely to churn compared to the old customers

Feel free to contact me for further details about the analysis or any feedback.
